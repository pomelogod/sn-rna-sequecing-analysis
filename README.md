# sn-rna-sequecing-analysis
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) analysis to identify a neuronal subpopulation co-expressing GABRQ, ADRA1A, FEZF2, and VAT1L, and to determine its transcriptional characteristics through pseudobulk differential expression.

Project Overview

This project aims to:

Identify the subpopulation of nuclei simultaneously expressing GABRQ, ADRA1A, FEZF2, and VAT1L within a single-nucleus RNA sequencing dataset.

Characterize this subpopulation by calculating:

The number and proportion of nuclei in this group.

Correlations with other annotated clusters.

Determine the enriched (upregulated) genes in this subpopulation using pseudobulk differential expression analysis.
